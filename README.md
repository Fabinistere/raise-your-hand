## Preview

## Contribute

Release's format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This project also follows to [A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

## Assets are excluded from git storage

Due to the inefficiency to store image in git,
all asset can be download here (from the latest version):
<!-- [Latest Assets - Google Drive](???) -->

or in the correct release note (if from other version):
<!-- [Releases - Github](???) -->
